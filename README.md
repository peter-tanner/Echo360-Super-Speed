### Done!

## Adding your own speeds

Open the userscript file, then modify the `selected_speeds` and/or `speed_hotkey_increment` constants which are in the `USER CUSTOMIZATION` section.

For example, if I wanted only 4x, 3x and 2x options, I can replace the `selected_speeds` constant with the following:

```js
const selected_speeds = [4, 3, 2];
```

âš  Note that there is a browser-set speed limit of 16x and speeds above 4x are muted, according to [the constants set in the brower's source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32320020). This applies to both Firefox and Chromium.

## Current issues

- When setting `selected_speeds` to a list of speeds which does not include 1x, the player by default loads with 1x speed when the page is loaded. Once the speed is changed manually by clicking on a speed from the dropdown this is not an issue anymore, but it would be nice if the default speed was valid.
